# Analyst Portfolio ‚Äì Edgar Aguilar

This repository presents my final Analyst Portfolio for the course **SIS-750: Data Analysis and Visualization**. The portfolio highlights my technical skills in **data wrangling**, **statistical analysis**, **visualization**, and **reproducible programming** using R.

It includes three key components:
1. A final **slide deck** from an independent data analysis project
2. A **codebook** and **data workflow** from a project on utility efficiency and market structure
3. A self-contained, well-commented **exemplary code chunk**
4. A tailored **analyst resume**

## Overview of Projects

### Slide Deck (`index.html`)

This slide deck presents an independent analysis project completed for the course. It demonstrates:
- Effective use of **RMarkdown + `xaringan`** for presentation
- Clean, compelling **data visualizations**
- Clear framing of a data-driven question and interpretation of results

---

### Codebook: Utility Efficiency & Market Structure

This report supports a project that benchmarked the operational efficiency of 49 electric utilities across 37 countries and linked those efficiency scores to market structure characteristics and access to electricity.

The codebook includes:
- A clear summary of the **data sources and variables**
- Description of the **DEA methodology**
- Key **descriptive statistics** and **visual summaries**
- Clean, reproducible layout for communicating technical findings


---

### Exemplary Code Chunk

This script demonstrates:
- Full pipeline for **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)** using the `Benchmarking` package
- Data cleaning, reshaping, and merging with policy and access indicators
- Clean, modular code with comments for replication

The code is also explained in a structured README inside the folder.

---

### Analyst Resume

A one-page resume emphasizing:
- Proficiency with R, RMarkdown, and data visualization tools
- Experience in data analysis for policy, energy, and international development
- Quantitative research and communication skills
